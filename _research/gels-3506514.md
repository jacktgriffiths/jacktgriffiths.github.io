title: "Three-dimensional pathology-simulating model of neurotrauma using a polymer encapsulated neural cell network"
collection: research
category: manuscripts
permalink: /research/3d_pathology_model
excerpt: '...We demonstrate that it is feasible to create a reproducible, focal traumatic injury in the synthesized neural tissue construct. Importantly, key pathological features of neurological injury such as astrocyte scarring, immune cell (microglial) activation, impeded axonal outgrowth and stem/progenitor cell migration can be successfully induced. We also prove that it is feasible to implant a biomaterial into the lesion gap to study neural cell responses for screening applications. The findings support the concept that the model can be used in a versatile manner for advanced neural modelling.'
